1- Why is this (not) working?

when I start with 
 - Which tile to put in place
 - On which side to put it on the game table

 i missed the one element and it's not working until I got help from Ilyes (my mentor) 


2 - How does this concept relate to that concept?

 I relied on small functions and then call back function 

3- Am I able to articulate what's happening?
 yes buy more comments and the function and variable name 

4- How is this application different/similar to my previous project?

here i used (lodash) I'm tried to learn it during this week in the other side it's good TA to work with vanilla JS
